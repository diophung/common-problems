Common Programming Problems
===============
A collection of programming topics and problems for your technical preparations.

#I. Data structures
##1. String, Array, List, LinkedList 
	a. String
	b. Array
	c. List, LinkedList (for collection and grouping problems).

##2. Tree, Graph
	Hierarchical structures for relationship/traversal problems. 

##3. Stack, Queue
	Support ordered/non-ordered addition/removal.

##4. HashTable / Dictionary / HashMap
	Quicker access to items based on indexes.
	
#II. Algorithm
##1. Sort, Search
	a. QuickSort, MergeSort
	b. BinarySearch
	c. DFS, BFS

##2. Recursion
	The first rule of understanding recursion is to understand recursion with simpler definition.
	a. Basic recursion
	b. Backtracking
	c. Recursion with Dynamic programming

##3. Bitwise operation
	

#III. System design
