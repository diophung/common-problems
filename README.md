Common Programming Problems
===============
A collection of programming problems involve data structures, common algorithms, and system designs.

#I. Data structure
##1. String, Array, List, LinkedList 
	a. String
	b. Array
	c. List, LinkedList (for collection and grouping problems).

##2. Tree, Graph
	For hiearchy structures and relationship/traversal. 


##3. Stack, Queue
	Basic data structures that support ordered/non-ordered addition/removal.

#II. Algorithm
##1. Sort, Search
	a. QuickSort, MergeSort
	b. BinarySearch
	c. DFS, BFS

##2. Recursion
	The first rule of understanding recursion is to understand recursion with simpler definition.
	a. Basic recursion
	b. Backtracking
	c. Recursion with Dynamic programming

#III. System design
##1. Distributed system
	a. Proper problem definition
	b. How to split & scale-up
	c. How to divide-and-conquer, how to MapReduce ?
	d. BigData
